SciFOAF builds a RDF/FOAF profile from NCBI/PUBMED

= Introduction =
SciFOAF is the second version of a tool I created to build a FOAF/RDF file from your publications in ncbi/pubmed. The FOAF project defines a semantic format based on RDF/XML to define persons or groups, their relationships, as well as their basic properties such as name, e-mail address, subjects of interest, publications, and so on... The first version was introduced in 2006 here as a java webstart interface and had many problems:

    * the RDF file could not be loaded/saved
    * only a few properties could be edited
    * authors'name definition may vary from one journal to another as some journal may use the initial of an author while another may use the complete first name.
    * the interaction was just a kind of multiple-choice questionnaire

The new version now uses the Jena API, the rdf repository can be loaded and saved.
